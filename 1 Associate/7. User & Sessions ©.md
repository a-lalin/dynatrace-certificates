## [Web Applications](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications)
Is a front-end of an application that can be accessed via a browser or mobile app.  
Tracks the user’s experience when they interact with a website or an app.
- **User Actions**  
    Clicks or user interactions.
- **XHR Actions**  
    Background requests, that update a parts of a page (like clicking "Next" in a photo gallery).
- **Custom Actions**  
    Business-specific actions that are being tracked manually (like PDF downloads, using the Dynatrace JavaScript API (OpenKit)).

By default, Dynatrace groups all web traffic under "My Web Application".
## [Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience)
Provides monitoring of user interactions across web, mobile, and other digital touchpoints, ensuring applications are available, functional, and performing well. Key components of DEM are [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](7.%20User%20&%20Sessions%20©.md#[Real%20User%20Monitoring%20(RUM)](https%20//docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder)) and [Synthetic Monitoring](7.%20User%20&%20Sessions%20©.md#[Synthetic%20Monitoring](https%20//docs.dynatrace.com/docs/license/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/browser-monitor-clickpath)).

## [Real User Monitoring (RUM)](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/define-your-applications-via-the-my-web-application-placeholder)
Real User Monitoring (RUM) tracks and analyzes real-time user interactions within applications. RUM provides insights into user behavior and performance metrics. This data is integrated into the DEM framework and application performance is fed into Business Analytics, allowing for a holistic view of the digital experience.

measures the performance of a front-end application from the perspective of an actual (real) user.
These measurements focus on performance, reliability, and responsiveness

Can monitor websites, mobile apps and custom applications (like smart devices)


Normally when you enter a website address or click a link, your browser sends a request to retrieve the webpage. The web server then constructs the page and sends it back to your browser so you can view it.

When a OneAgent is monitoring the web-server, you enter a website to request a webpage like you did before, with the exception that now when the web-server constructs the page, the OneAgent tells the web-server to insert a JavaScript Snippet to monitor the page.

The JavaScript Snippet is a part of the OneAgent that collects monitoring data about the user’s experience on the page.

This entire process is called “Auto Injection”.

Now with the JavaScript Snippet on the page, we can monitor the user’s experience!

  

Dynatrace routes traffic to the correct application using detection rules, these are typically based on things like URL patterns.  Admins set these rules to make sure each application's data goes into the right place.

For example, traffic to Astroshop.com might be routed to an application named Astroshop, while traffic to another domain gets bucketed into a different application.

  

Dynatrace can capture **IP address** (user's location, which can be masked for privacy or compliance needs), **browser type** (Chrome, Edge, Safari, etc.) and user type (Real user, synthetics, bots)

Performance User Experience Score (Apdex)

widely used scoring system for measuring user experience

- **0 to 3 seconds**  
    the user is considered **satisfied**
- **3 to 15 seconds**  
    the experience is **tolerable**
- **over 15 seconds**  
    or if the action results in an error like a 404 “Page Not Found,” is considered **frustrating**

Apdex of 1 is an ultimate goal, best possible user experience 

  

## [Mobile RUM](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/mobile-applications) 

123

## [Agentless RUM XXX](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/initial-setup/set-up-agentless-real-user-monitoring)

Is an alternative method, when you can't install OneAgent on a web server, the app’s technology doesn’t support auto-injection or security policies or restrictions prevent installations of OneAgent on the web server

With this methods you need to manually insert the Dynatrace JavaScript snippet into each relevant page, such as login, homepage or search page. If the JavaScript tag isn’t on a specific page, then it will not be monitored

User Actions XXX

Load Actions: These actions occur when a full page is loaded, like visiting the home page, login page, or search results.

XHR Actions (XMLHttpRequest): These actions are triggered when part of the page updates without a full reload, like applying filters or updating a product image.

Custom Actions: These actions aren't captured automatically. You define them using the Dynatrace JavaScript API.

For example: If there is an action that Dynatrace does not capture by default that needs to be measured, you can use a JavaScript API call to monitor that action.

For applications that are not web or mobile based, Dynatrace offers a package called Dynatrace OpenKit. This allows you to monitor thick clients that operate outside of a web browser using traditional Java, .NET, or C code.

For example: If there is an action that occurs as a part of a user utilizing an installed client on a machine rather than a web browser, OpenKit allows the capture of those user sessions.

Setting up these custom actions is usually done by the development team who also commonly coordinates with an application team. The application team decides what actions they want to track and where to place the JavaScript code provided by Dynatrace which is then commonly implemented by the development team.

  

Key User Actions

You can mark specific user actions as Key User Actions to:

  
Customize Apdex thresholds for important pages (e.g., require login pages to load under 2 seconds)  
  
Add them to dashboards for easy monitoring  
  
Enable long-term storage of that user action’s data (Likely to change with Grail)

  

  

For Deeper Analysis you can use

Waterfall analysis

Shows the loading sequence of page elements (like scripts, images, CCS).

Helps pinpoint exactly what’s slowing down a user’s action.

Based on W3C timing standards, no proprietary metrics.

  

Error Analysis

Breaks down JavaScript or request-related errors tied to specific user actions.

Great for identifying bugs affecting user experience.

  

INFO  
Looking Ahead: The Role of Grail

Dynatrace is evolving. With the introduction of Grail, the storage and structure of RUM data (including user actions) will change. However, the core concepts of capturing and analyzing user actions will stay the same. Tools like waterfall analysis and error insights will still help you to understand what users experience.

  

## User Sessions

#### [Session segmentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/session-segmentation)
asd
#### [User behaviour analysis](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/user-behavior-analysis)
The **User behavior analysis** section displays a number of key performance metrics regarding user behavior, like bounces, top landing and exit pages, conversions and many more. Just expand the **User behavior analysis** section of the infographic on the [application overview page](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/introduction-to-application-overview "Read an overview of the analysis options offered on the application overview page.") to view the user behavior analysis options.
Captures Page Loads, Payments, Errors, Page Navigation, etc


#### [# Performance analysis](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/web-applications/analyze-and-use/performance-analysis)

Dynatrace can also tag user sessions with identifiers such usernames or email addresses. For example, if a web page says, “Welcome Ryan”. You can configure Dynatrace to recognize “Ryan” as the user. This is useful for identifying users and connecting their behavior to performance issues.

tagging setup is typically handled by someone familiar with the application’s code.

  

Along with user actions, Dynatrace automatically captures technical and environment data, including:

1Tagged and identifiers (e.g., usernames, emails)

2Applications visited

3Screen resolution

4Browser and operating system

5Device type

6And more

  

Analyse User Behaviour 

User sessions allow you to go beyond performance and explore user behavior:

  
Where do users enter and exit the site?

Spot drop-off points, like a failed search page  

We can analyse bounce rate

A bounce is when someone performs one action (like opening a page) and leaves right away, often due to slow load times or poor experience.

  

Are users following expected paths?

Are they completing purchases or logging in as expected?

  

  

Conversion Goals

Dynatrace lets you define conversion goals, specific events that indicate a successful session. Common types of conversion goals include:

Visiting a specific page (e.g. “Payment Finish”).

Performing a certain number of actions.

Staying on the site for a minimum amount of time.

  

 Most often, goals are set based on a specific user action, such as completing a purchase.

  

Note:

It can take about 30 minutes for a new conversion goal to show results in Dynatrace.

For a session to count toward a conversion goal, the session must be marked as completed. Which leads us to our next topic. When is a User Session considered completed?

  

  

When is a user session considered completed?

A user session in Dynatrace is considered complete for a web application under the following conditions:

1After 35 minutes of browser inactivity (e.g., user walks away from browser)

2When the browser window is closed (closing a tab does not end the session)

3Eight hours of activity (rare, but limits are in place)

4More than 200 user actions, a new session starts on the 201st (no affected by licensing)

5Using the Javascript API to call the dtrum.endSession() function. This can be used to customize when a user session is completed for an application (ex: when a user logs out)

  

  

Licensing and Session Counts

Each user session typically consumes one license in Dynatrace. However, there are important exceptions and nuances to keep in mind

  

Bounce sessions may not be counted

Sessions where a user performs only a single action, such as loading a page without clicking or interacting, are typically excluded from license consumption. These are often referred to as "bounce sessions."

  

Licensing terms can vary by contract

Specific licensing rules, thresholds, or exclusions may differ depending on your plan or agreement. To ensure accurate tracking and budgeting, consult your account representative for guidance tailored to your organization.

  

  

Privacy and Data Masking

Dynatrace RUM may encounter data that should remain hidden from users. Fortunately, Dynatrace can mask sensitive user data, including: Email addresses, IP addresses, Physical locations

This ensures privacy while still allowing teams to analyze patterns and performance. If you see the word “masked” in a session, it means the data is either hidden by policy or you don’t have the proper user permissions.

  

## [Synthetic Monitoring](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/license/capabilities/digital-experience-monitoring/browser-monitor-clickpath)
Synthetic monitoring simulates user interactions with applications using automated scripts, identifying performance issues before they affect real users. This proactive testing provides valuable data for Business Analytics, helping understand how performance impacts key metrics.


Synthetic Monitoring in Dynatrace simulates a real user visiting a website to monitor its availability and performance, even when no actual users are online. This makes it possible to monitor web applications 24/7, detect issues early, and ensures a smooth digital experience.

  

Visualize yourself running a school website that doesn’t get much traffic at night. If the site goes down at 2 a.m., no one may notice until morning. But with Synthetic Monitoring, a simulated user can “visit” the site and alert your team immediately if something is wrong, without impacting any real users.

  

We can configure synthetics to notify about:

1. Downtime (site is unreachable)

2. Slow page performance

3. Failed logins or broken user flows

  

  

There are 3 types of synthetic monitors:

Browser monitors

Simulate loading a single page (e.g., your login or home page)

Ideal for basic uptime and performance checks

Browser Clickpath Monitors

Simulate a full user journey (e.g., log in -> search -> purchase)

Useful for testing entire workflow across multiple pages.

*Note: You will need to install Dynatrace Synthetic Recording browser extension for Chrome to create clickpaths.

HTTP Monitors

Check API endpoints or URL that don’t load a visual page

Think of it like sending “ping” or "curl" requests: “Hey, are you there?”

  

  

Global Coverage

Synthetics monitors run from public Dynatrace locations around the world. You can choose specific test locations, like the U.S., Europe, or Australia, to see how your app performs from different regions.

  

Do you need OneAgent to use synthetics?

No, you don’t need to install OneAgent to use synthetics. Everything runs from those public Dynatrace locations!

  

  

Note that after setup, it can take up to 15-30 minutes for synthetic monitor to become active, especially for complex clickpaths.

  

  

Where Synthetics fit in Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM)

Synthetics are a key part of Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) in Dynatrace, along with Real User Monitoring (RUM).

RUM = tracks real users interacting with your site.

Synthetics = Simulate users to proactively test availability and performance.

Together, they give a complete view of how your application behaves and performs from both real and simulated perspectives.

  

[https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/digital-experience/synthetic-monitoring/browser-monitors/configure-browser-monitors)

  

=====

Now that we've explored the role of synthetics in Digital Experience Monitoring, we can look at how they can be tailored to meet our specific goals. Customizing synthetics allows teams to simulate real user behavior and focus on key user journeys.

  

Frequency and Locations

You can easily change how often the synthetic runs (e.g. every 15 minutes or every hour) and from which location it executes.

  

Outage Handling

You can define how many consecutives failures should trigger a problem.

For example:

1 failure = ignore

3 failures in a row = raise alert.

  

Performance Thresholds

Want to ensure a specific page load in under 3 seconds? Set the performance threshold, and Dynatrace will alert it’s exceeded.

  

  

On-Demand Execution

Need to test immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduled run? You can manually execute a synthetic anytime.

Dynatrace also offers an API for remote execution!

For example: A developer could build a mobile app that triggers a synthetic test remotely, just like controlling a smart thermostat from your phone.

======

  

  

  

Credential Vault

If your synthetic needs to log in with credentials, you can store usernames and passwords securely in the Credential Vault. This keeps login details private and allows others to build synthetics without seeing sensitive information.

For example, you ask a teammate to set up a synthetic and tell them, “Use the credentials stored in the vault,” no need to share an actual password.

  

  

Private Synthetic Locations

Some applications live in private networks and aren’t accessible from public Dynatrace locations. 

  

Option 1: Whitelist Dynatrace IPs

  

Allow specific Dynatrace Synthetic IPs through your network.  
Think of like showing a badge at the door, “I’m trusted, let me in”

  

Option 2: Private Synthetic Locations

  

Set up synthetics inside your network using ActiveGate.  
Because the synthetic is already in the network, and assuming it’s configured properly, it will have no problems accessing private internal applications.

  

## Session Replay

What is Session Replay?

Session Replay in Dynatrace allows you to visually recreate a user’s journey through your application, without recording any video or screen content. It’s not actual recording, but a reconstruction of what the user saw and did, based on collected data.

This is especially helpful identifying tricky front-end issues, like when a user clicks a button, but nothing seems to happen, or endless spinners due to an element failing to load.

  

  

Well, why does this matter? Select the cards to learn the reasons why Session Replay is important.

No sensitive recordings are stored  
It saves massive amounts of storage space and cost.  

  
Masking sensitive information

By default, Session Replay masks sensitive user data, like text, form fields, images, and dropdown values. This ensures that personal information stays protected.

You will see the layout of the page, but the actual content will be hidden unless you explicitly configure Dynatrace to unmask certain elements.

For example, you might want to unmask a product image or display a user’s name, but passwords and other private data will ALWAYS remain masked by design.

  

  
  
Why use Session Replay?

There are a few important reasons we use Session Replay at Dynatrace:  
Troubleshoot hard-to-reproduce frontend issues  
Understand exactly what a user did before an error occurred  
Improve support and development responses times  
Maintain full visibility while protecting privacy
