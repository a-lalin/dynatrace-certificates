## [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection) ©
an anomaly is when a metric breaches a defined threshold, meaning something is no longer behaving as expected

By default, a metric must exceed the **50% baseline** for Dynatrace to detect an anomaly

Once an anomaly is detected, Dynatrace either creates a new problem or attaches the anomaly to an already existing problem

- **Static thresholds**
    Waits until the condition is met. Doesn’t immediately trigger a problem, but waits to confirm that the condition persists, usually around 5 minutes
- **Auto-adaptive thresholds** (baselines)  
    are established after two hours of monitoring, but get smarter over time, refining daily. Typically forms after about a week  
    Single deviation might be ignored, but persistent anomalies are detected and Dynatrace flags it as a problem
#### Root Cause Analysis
groups related anomalies into a single issue. It uses topology mapping to understand how systems connect. This allows it to group related anomalies **into a single problem**

- **Failure Analysis**  
    Helps pinpoint spikes in application errors
- **Response time Hotspots**  
    Highlights services or methods causing slowdowns
- **Distributed Traces**  
    Breaks down requests to see where delays occur
- **Business Impact Analysis**  
    Shows which users were impacted and how

## [Davis AI](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai) and Problem Settings

Davis is the AI engine inside Dynatrace and has the following categories

- **Casual Correlation Analysis**

- Detects anomalies
- Determines root causes
- Groups related problems together
- Understands system topology

- **Davis Seasonal Baseline**

- Creates auto-adaptive thresholds
- Learns seasonal behavior of application metrics

- **Forecast Analysis**

- Used in dashboards and notebooks to predict future values for a given metric

- **Anomaly Detection Settings**  
    Fine-tune when and how anomalies are triggered  
    These can be set globally or per entity
- **Alerting Profiles**  
    Control of what types of problems trigger notifications
- **Problem Notifications**  
    Configure how alerts are sent, by email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other channels
