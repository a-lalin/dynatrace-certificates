## [Problems](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/dynatrace-intelligence/davis-problems-app) ©
> Availability, Error, Slowdown, Resource, Custom (**NOT Memory saturation!**)

Quickly triaging, investigating, and remediating incoming incidents is the core challenge for operations teams.
#### Problems Overview
The **Overview** is a concise, executive summary of a detected problem
##### Impact
The **Impact** section displays all impacted **[Smartscape](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/smartscape-classic "Learn how Smartscape Classic visualizes all the entities and dependencies in your environment.")** entities (for example, services, processes, and hosts) along with brief issue details for each entity.

The **Impact** section is categorised by:
- **Frontends**
- **Services**
- **Infrastructure**
- **Synthetic monitoring**
- **Environment**
##### Root cause
The **Root cause** section focuses on the root cause of the issue, including detailed information about the affected deployment stack. This may include:
- The process and host where the root-cause service is running.
- The Kubernetes workload serving the impacted service.
To ensure consistency, the root-cause entity is also listed in the **Impact** table.
##### Visual resolution path
The **Visual resolution path** section graphically illustrates the relationships between frontends, services, and backends involved in the issue.
##### Automation and remediation
The **Automation and remediation** section lists all automation workflows triggered by the problem. These workflows may include:
- Alert notifications sent to response teams.
- Remediation flows and runbooks for auto-remediation.
- External AI agent triggers, such as cloud platform SRE agents, to gather further insights or resolve issues within cloud vendor infrastructure.
The table provides key details for each workflow, including:
- The last trigger time (as workflows may run multiple times during problem updates).
- The execution state (for example, success or failure).
## [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection) ©
an anomaly is when a metric breaches a defined threshold, meaning something is no longer behaving as expected.
> By default, a metric must exceed the **50% baseline** for Dynatrace to detect an anomaly.

Once an anomaly is detected, Dynatrace either creates a new problem or attaches the anomaly to an already existing problem.

- **Static thresholds**
    Waits until the condition is met. Doesn’t immediately trigger a problem, but waits to confirm that the condition persists, usually around 5 minutes.
- **Auto-adaptive thresholds** (baselines)  
    are established after two hours of monitoring, but get smarter over time, refining daily. Typically forms after about a week.
    Single deviation might be ignored, but persistent anomalies are detected and Dynatrace flags it as a problem.
## [Root Cause Analysis](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai/root-cause-analysis)
Groups related anomalies into a single issue. It uses topology mapping to understand how systems connect. This allows it to group related anomalies **into a single problem**.
- **Failure Analysis**  
    Helps pinpoint spikes in application errors.
- **Response time Hotspots**  
    Highlights services or methods causing slowdowns.
- **Distributed Traces**  
    Breaks down requests to see where delays occur.
- **Business Impact Analysis**  
    Shows which users were impacted and how.

## [Davis AI](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai) and Problem Settings
Davis is the AI engine inside Dynatrace and has the following categories:
* **Casual Correlation Analysis**
	- Detects anomalies.
	- Determines root causes.
	- Groups related problems together.
	- Understands system topology.
* **Davis Seasonal Baseline**
	- Creates auto-adaptive thresholds.
	- Learns seasonal behavior of application metrics.
* **Forecast Analysis**
	* Used in dashboards and notebooks to predict future values for a given metric.
* **Anomaly Detection Settings**
	* Fine-tune when and how anomalies are triggered.
	* These can be set globally or per entity.
* **Alerting Profiles**
	* Control of what types of problems trigger notifications.
* **Problem Notifications**
	* Configure how alerts are sent, by email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other channels.

## [Application Security](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/secure/application-security)
Dynatrace can analyse application code at runtime to **detect vulnerabilities**.
It doesn’t just scan the code like a static tool; it watches the code while it’s running.
> Dynatrace knows what code is actually being used and can alert if any 3rd party libraries have vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Vulnerability Analytics**
  This flags known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks.
* **Runtime Application Protection**
   This blocks real-time attacks, like SQL injections or DDoS attempts.
   
Dynatrace also gives each vulnerability a DSS or Davis Security Score. This is calculated with the help of our partner **[Snyk](https://snyk.io/)**, and Davis’s understanding of the environment’s topology. This helps teams prioritise critical issues that are most important, or ones affecting a high number of processes.

#### Davis Security Advisor calculations
##### [Davis Security Advisor calculations](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-advisor)
Recommends the fixes that would most improve the overall security of your environment. Is shown in **Third-Party Vulnerabilities**.
##### [Davis Score Score calculations](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/secure/application-security/vulnerability-analytics/third-party-vulnerabilities/davis-security-score)
Davis Security Score (DSS) is an enhanced risk-calculation score based on the industry-standard **[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System)**﻿. Davis AI is designed to provide a more precise risk-assessment score by considering additional parameters such as public internet exposure and whether or not data assets are reachable from an affected entity.
