## [Anomaly Detection](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai/anomaly-detection/adjust-sensitivity-anomaly-detection) ©
an anomaly is when a metric breaches a defined threshold, meaning something is no longer behaving as expected.
> By default, a metric must exceed the **50% baseline** for Dynatrace to detect an anomaly.

Once an anomaly is detected, Dynatrace either creates a new problem or attaches the anomaly to an already existing problem.

- **Static thresholds**
    Waits until the condition is met. Doesn’t immediately trigger a problem, but waits to confirm that the condition persists, usually around 5 minutes.
- **Auto-adaptive thresholds** (baselines)  
    are established after two hours of monitoring, but get smarter over time, refining daily. Typically forms after about a week.
    Single deviation might be ignored, but persistent anomalies are detected and Dynatrace flags it as a problem.
## Root Cause Analysis
Groups related anomalies into a single issue. It uses topology mapping to understand how systems connect. This allows it to group related anomalies **into a single problem**.
- **Failure Analysis**  
    Helps pinpoint spikes in application errors.
- **Response time Hotspots**  
    Highlights services or methods causing slowdowns.
- **Distributed Traces**  
    Breaks down requests to see where delays occur.
- **Business Impact Analysis**  
    Shows which users were impacted and how.

## [Davis AI](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/platform/davis-ai) and Problem Settings
Davis is the AI engine inside Dynatrace and has the following categories:
* **Casual Correlation Analysis**
	- Detects anomalies.
	- Determines root causes.
	- Groups related problems together.
	- Understands system topology.
* **Davis Seasonal Baseline**
	- Creates auto-adaptive thresholds.
	- Learns seasonal behavior of application metrics.
* **Forecast Analysis**
	* Used in dashboards and notebooks to predict future values for a given metric.
* **Anomaly Detection Settings**
	* Fine-tune when and how anomalies are triggered.
	* These can be set globally or per entity.
* **Alerting Profiles**
	* Control of what types of problems trigger notifications.
* **Problem Notifications**
	* Configure how alerts are sent, by email, Slack, PagerDuty, or other channels.

## Application Security
Dynatrace does not just stop at monitoring but can also be used for application security.

Dynatrace can analyze application code at runtime to detect vulnerabilities. It doesn’t just scan the code like a static tool; it watches the code while it’s running. This means Dynatrace knows what code is actually being used and can alert if any 3rd party libraries have vulnerabilities.

Select the cards to reveal the two main capabilities Dynatrace uses to detect vulnerabilities at runtime.

  

Runtime Vulnerability Analytics  
This flags known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks.

  

Runtime Application Protection  
This blocks real-time attacks, like SQL injections or DDoS attempts.

  

So Dynatrace isn’t just showing you issues, it’s helping protect your applications while they run!

Dynatrace also gives each vulnerability a DSS or Davis Security Score. This is calculated with the help of our partner Snyk, and Davis’s understanding of the environment’s topology. This helps teams prioritize critical issues that are most important, or ones affecting a high number of processes.



Dynatrace can be extended with Apps Extensions, Cloud Integrations, OpenTelemetry, SDKs, Workflows, and APIs.  
Extensions let you collect extra data for technologies not configured by default.  
Workflows and APIs help automate tasks and integrate with external systems.  
Logs ingestion and Business Events give you flexible control over additional data that’s collected.  
Application Security helps protect your code in real time.  
Kubernetes monitoring is handled by the Dynatrace Operator.
