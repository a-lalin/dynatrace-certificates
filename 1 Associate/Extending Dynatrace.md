## Extending Dynatrace

  

Why Extend Dynatrace?

You might be wondering why you need to extend something like Dynatrace?  Isn’t it already collecting tons of data? Well, yes, and that is exactly why.


Think of Dynatrace like a smartphone. Right out of the box, it can do a lot, text, take photos, browse the internet. But you probably still install apps and add accessories to make it better fit your lifestyle.

It’s the same with Dynatrace. The core platform gives you a lot: it collects real user data, metrics, logs, traces, and so on. But not every customer uses the same technologies or needs the same level of detail.

  

That’s why not everything is enabled or added by default. Activating everything means we could be collecting unnecessary data or have apps and features that clutter what we really find important. So instead, Dynatrace lets you turn on what you need when you need it, and this is where the Dynatrace Hub comes in.

  

  

## Application Security

Dynatrace does not just stop at monitoring but can also be used for application security.

Dynatrace can analyze application code at runtime to detect vulnerabilities. It doesn’t just scan the code like a static tool; it watches the code while it’s running. This means Dynatrace knows what code is actually being used and can alert if any 3rd party libraries have vulnerabilities.

Select the cards to reveal the two main capabilities Dynatrace uses to detect vulnerabilities at runtime.

  

Runtime Vulnerability Analytics  
This flags known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or frameworks.

  

Runtime Application Protection  
This blocks real-time attacks, like SQL injections or DDoS attempts.

  

So Dynatrace isn’t just showing you issues, it’s helping protect your applications while they run!

Dynatrace also gives each vulnerability a DSS or Davis Security Score. This is calculated with the help of our partner Snyk, and Davis’s understanding of the environment’s topology. This helps teams prioritize critical issues that are most important, or ones affecting a high number of processes.

  

  



Dynatrace can be extended with Apps Extensions, Cloud Integrations, OpenTelemetry, SDKs, Workflows, and APIs.  
Extensions let you collect extra data for technologies not configured by default.  
Workflows and APIs help automate tasks and integrate with external systems.  
Logs ingestion and Business Events give you flexible control over additional data that’s collected.  
Application Security helps protect your code in real time.  
Kubernetes monitoring is handled by the Dynatrace Operator.
