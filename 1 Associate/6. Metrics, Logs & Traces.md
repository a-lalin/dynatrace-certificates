## Logs & Traces ©

Dynatrace has dedicated apps for logs and traces. These apps let you explore massive amounts of log or trace data pulled from Grail. You can narrow things down with filters, like:

  

Log level, Keywords or Phrases, Security content

Note: This content can be used to restrict access based on user roles.


These apps can also generate DQL queries for you. That’s a big help if you’re still getting comfortable with the language. Let’s take a look at how these apps look like!







Metrics, Logs and Traces are all captured automatically  
Dynatrace can also collect Security Events, Business Events, Deployment Related Events etc

## [Metrics](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/metrics)
> **[Metrics classic](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/metrics-classic)**
> **[Built-in Metrics on Grail](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/metrics/built-in-metrics-on-grail)**

like CPU, Memory, Response times, Error rates, or how many users are active.

Help paint a big picture view of system health and performance.  
Spikes or drops can be a signal that something is off

## Logs

capture **events**: who did what, when it happened, and what the system reported about it  
_successful login, a failed payment, an internal error message, etc_

## [Log Content Analysis](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/logs/lma-analysis)
Log Management and Analytics gives you direct access to the log content of all your system's mission-critical processes. Log data typically contain a lot of information. One way to handle a large amount of data is to narrow down the log records and parse them.

## Traces
Follows the path of a single request as it moves through an application

From the moment a user clicks "Buy Now" to the very last system it touches

Tracing shows where time is spent along the way
- action on the web server (1 sec)
- action on the middleware server (1 sec)
- action on the database (4 sec) → That's not normal, and now we know where to look

Traces are made of **spans**, which represent the units of work within a distributed trace
