Dynatrace offers **application observability**, this is not just a monitoring tool.
The essence of application observability — it’s the ability to understand an **application health**, **performance**, and **behavior** from inside out.

Dynatrace → **Software as a Service** (SaaS) platform.
It does all its processing on a dedicated server; users can access all data through a browser.
## Tool consolidation
Dynatrace brings all those monitoring capabilities into a **single**, **unified** **platform**
* **Fewer tools** mean **reduced complexity** and lower operational overhead.
* Teams can **focus on** more **enhancing performance** and user experience.
* **Licensing**, **maintenance**, and setup **efforts are minimised** with a single solution.
## Root Cause Determination
Dynatrace doesn't just alert us to a problem, **it shows us the root cause**. By finding the why behind performance issues, Dynatrace helps us move quickly, stay confident, and keep things running smoothly.
## Extending Dynatrace
  
> [!question] Why Extend Dynatrace?
> Isn’t it already collecting tons of data? Well, yes, and that is exactly why.

Think of Dynatrace like a smartphone. Right out of the box, it can do a lot, text, take photos, browse the internet. But you probably still install apps and add accessories to make it better fit your lifestyle.
It’s the same with Dynatrace. The core platform gives you a lot: it collects real user data, metrics, logs, traces, and so on. But not every customer uses the same technologies or needs the same level of detail.
That’s why **not everything is enabled** or added **by default**. Activating everything means **we could be collecting unnecessary data** or have apps and features that clutter what we really find important.
So instead, Dynatrace lets you turn on what you need when you need it, and this is where the **[Dynatrace Hub](2.%20Data%20Collection.md#Dynatrace%20Hub)** comes in.
