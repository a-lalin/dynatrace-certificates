## General information
**[Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/what-is-dynatrace)** offers **application observability**, this is not just a monitoring tool.
The essence of application observability — it’s the ability to understand an **application health**, **performance**, and **behavior** from inside out.

Dynatrace → **Software as a Service** (SaaS) platform.
It does all its processing on a dedicated server; users can access all data through a browser.
## The Dynatrace Platform
Dynatrace is an **observability platform** to analyse, automate, and innovate with the power of AI.
It helps you prevent problems, automate workflows, and deliver better, more secure software faster.
- **Observability**
	  Real-time monitoring and visualisation of application performance & infrastructure.
- **Security**
	  Enterprise-grade data privacy and compliance management.
- **Automation**
	  Automated discovery and analysis using AI-driven insights.
- **Integration**
	  Supports various cloud, container, and technology integrations.
Dynatrace helps organisations predict, prevent, and resolve issues before they impact customers, driving better business outcomes.
## Tool consolidation
Dynatrace brings all those monitoring capabilities into a **single**, **unified** **platform**
* **Fewer tools** mean **reduced complexity** and lower operational overhead.
* Teams can **focus on** more **enhancing performance** and user experience.
* **Licensing**, **maintenance**, and setup **efforts are minimised** with a single solution.
## Root Cause Determination
Dynatrace doesn't just alert us to a problem, **it shows us the root cause**. By finding the why behind performance issues, Dynatrace helps us move quickly, stay confident, and keep things running smoothly.
## Extending Dynatrace
  
> [!question] Why Extend Dynatrace?
> Isn’t it already collecting tons of data? Well, yes, and that is exactly why.

> Think of Dynatrace like a smartphone. Right out of the box, it can do a lot, text, take photos, browse the internet. But you probably still install apps and add accessories to make it better fit your lifestyle.
> It’s the same with Dynatrace. The core platform gives you a lot: it collects real user data, metrics, logs, traces, and so on. But not every customer uses the same technologies or needs the same level of detail.

That’s why **not everything is enabled** or added **by default**. Activating everything means **we could be collecting unnecessary data** or have apps and features that clutter what we really find important.
So instead, Dynatrace lets you turn on what you need when you need it, and this is where the **[Dynatrace Hub](2.%20Data%20Collection.md#Dynatrace%20Hub)** comes in.
