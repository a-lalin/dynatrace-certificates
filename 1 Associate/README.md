## Exam
The exam consists of 60 written questions and 10-15 practical questions.

> **There is no exact information** about how many % counts as a passed exam.
> Some rumours suggested that in order to pass the exam you have to gain **at least 80%**.
> It is also not clear how much each theory/practise question is valued, but suggesting they all cost roughly the same you would have to complete all practical questions and 45 theory questions to pass the exam.
> **This is all speculations, though.**

* **1h: Multiple choice & multiple response questions**
    **Multiple-choice**
	    Select one option from a list that best answers the question or completes the statement.
    **Multiple-response**
	    Select multiple options from a list to answer the question or complete the statement.
		Multiple-response test items are clearly identified. **Partial percentage for each correct answer is given**, and that **same percentage is deducted for an incorrect choice**, however, this does not result in negative points for the question overall.
* **2h: Hands-on Practical, coding exercise**
	    Complete the tasks as directed and upload the screenshots and/or files as required.
